    "\n",
    "Recently, I stumbled upon [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), a deep learning library with a very eye catching slogan: *Making neural nets uncool again*.\n",
    "As it turns out, there is also a very [good course](https://course.fast.ai/) on this library from one of its creators, Jeremy Howard, that is very much hands on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of Lesson 3 is to build a Digit Classifier from hand written images based on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).\n",
    "But before training any models, Jeremy explains that one should always create a simplistic baseline to later put the performance of the fancy machine learning models into perspective.\n",
    "The baseline should be easy to implement, e.g., by only relying on simple arithmetic operations.\n",
    "The key idea of the lessons' baseline is to average the pixel values for each digit (in our small example below only we only use the digits 3 and 7) and then compute the difference between a given digit image to these average.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last few years, I did a lot of typical data scientist tasks as part of my PhD.\n",
    "One thing that I always found quite fascinating is how NumPy treats arrays with different dimensions/ranks during arithmetic operations through a mechanism called **broadcasting**.\n",
    "PyTorch tensors also support this mechanism and I really liked how Jeremy used it for creating the baseline.\n",
    "In addition, I think that Jeremys explained very well how broadcasting works so I decided to summarize it in this blog post.\n"

That is, it will automatically expand the tensor [actually PyTorch only pretends to expand the tensor, it does not allocate any extra memory] with the smaller rank to have the same size as the one with the larger rank. Broadcasting is an important capability that makes tensor code much easier to write. After broadcasting so the two argument tensors have the same rank, PyTorch applies its usual logic for two tensors of the same rank: it performs the operation on each corresponding element of the two tensors, and returns the tensor result.*\n",
